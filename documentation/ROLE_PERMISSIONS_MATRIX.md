## Important Security Rules & System Constraints
1. **Immutable Billing Records**: Once a Running Account (RA) or Final Bill is created and registered in the database, it cannot be modified or deleted by *any* user (including Admins) to maintain audit compliance.
2. **Sequential Billing Enforcement**: Bill $N$ cannot be registered unless bill $N-1$ has already been created. The system verifies this sequence programmatically.
3. **Revision Deadlines**: When a revision is requested on a Cost Estimate, the system displays a live countdown timer. If the deadline expires before submission, the form locks down automatically for all non-admin roles.
4. **Server-Side Security Verification**: The frontend interface hides elements and routes based on roles, but the backend Express.js server inspects all incoming JWT requests to enforce the permissions outlined in the table above.
